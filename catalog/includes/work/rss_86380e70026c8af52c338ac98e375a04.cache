We're proud to announce the introduction of a new App endeavor with the release of PayPal App for osCommerce Online Merchant!<br><br>
We've worked in close collaboration with PayPal to not only bring you updated PayPal payment modules but have also bundled all PayPal modules, including Log In with PayPal, into a single App package for an even tighter integration with osCommerce Online Merchant to enhance both sellers and buyers experiences with PayPal.<br><br>
The PayPal App is optimized for and will be bundled with the upcoming osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.5 release and can be installed on existing installations from v2.2RC2a to v2.3.4.<br><br>
The PayPal App has been architectured to preview and showcase the direction we are taking the new osCommerce Online Merchant v2.4 series in and how the new series will allow you to install and update Apps on your online store through the Administration Dashboard. The PayPal App includes an online update feature that can update itself with a click of a button that will be part of the core in v2.4 for all Apps to take advantage of.<br><br>
We are also extremely proud to be one of the first self-hosted e-commerce solutions to allow the PayPal App to configure itself by securely retrieving the PayPal account API Credentials for you. This is currently available for US and UK sellers and allows you to sign into or create a PayPal live or sandbox account to retrieve the API Credentials from. This makes it extremely easy for new PayPal sellers to start experiencing the PayPal payment methods through a sandbox account and to create a live account as soon as they are ready to accept payments - directly from the osCommerce Administration Dashboard.<br><br>
In addition, the PayPal App includes:<br><br>
- Updated payment modules<br>
- Payments Standard: Support for Payment Data Transfer (PDT) payments<br>
- Payments Standard: Stock management in IPN notifications<br>
- Order Administration: Capture full or partial authorizations, refund full or partial transactions<br>
- API Logging: All parameters sent in and received from API calls are logged<br><br>
Documentation for the PayPal App is available at:<br><br><a href="http://library.oscommerce.com/Package&amp;paypal">http://library.oscommerce.com/Package&amp;paypal</a><br><br>
The PayPal App can be downloaded for free at:<br><br><a href="http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9184">http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9184</a><br><br>
